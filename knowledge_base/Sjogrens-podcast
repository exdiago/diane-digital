**Introduction:**
Welcome to another episode of Sjogren Strong. This is Lupe.

And I'm Brian. Today we are joined by Diane Sanders, who is into holistic medicine and alternative approaches. And we are going to have a conversation with her to help better treat Sjogren syndrome and the symptoms up. So welcome to the show, Diane.

**Diane:** No, thank you very much. Glad to be here.

**Hosts:** We're so happy you're sharing a Saturday afternoon when we're recording this with us. Evening for you being on the East Coast. So why don't you start off by telling us a little bit about you and how you got into holistic approaches?

## Diane's Background and Journey into Holistic Medicine

**Diane:** Yeah, definitely. I actually got into it about maybe about five years ago. And I started with my own personal health challenges. I had a thyroid issue that I had started to investigate because I was going to need to take some medicine for it. And I remember the words of my doc when I went in to get my blood work done, him telling me that I was going to need to take this type of medicine for life. And that was kind of shocking to me. And I'm thinking, I don't want to take something every single day of my life.

And so at the time, I started to investigate what other alternatives there were out there for me. And I had a friend of mine that was into essential oils. And she had invited me to a class. And so I went with her. And I started to ask some questions about, you know, my particular circumstance and what essential oils might work with them. And they were given, there was like three different oils that were given to me.

And so I went in and tried those on. I would apply them topically. And I did it day and night. I did that for about three months. And I went back to my doctor, got my blood work done. And my thyroid had kicked in. And so I was just so amazed in how that had worked. As a biology major, I now had to investigate this. I had to go full bore on why these oils work and how my body worked with them.

**Host:** Okay. I'm going to interrupt you for a second. Sure. So you're applying essential oils three to, I'm assuming your throat being closest to your thyroid.

**Diane:** Correct.

**Host:** And it allowed you to come off of thyroid medication that was prescribed by a doctor.

**Diane:** Correct.

**Host:** All right. I'm going to let you pick up where you left off. But we're definitely going to circle back because I want to understand what those three were, what you found with your research, having understood a great understanding of biology. So I started interrupt.

**Diane:** Sure. That's all right. That's all right. Anytime.

## Sharing Knowledge and Becoming "The Health Detective"

So once I started to see how they worked, I actually started to not share with my friends and family when they would come up with things that they had going on with their health. I would investigate, open up my reference material and just provide what was in the reprisome material for their particular needs. And most of the time, they would work. And I would be just so amazed because I wanted to be this skeptic. I'm like, okay, it says here at work, I don't know. Here you go. Try it. And I was just so amazed by that.

So I decided that in some different circumstances and some different testimonials that I had with folks to now have that become part of my life journey to learn more about this and to share it with people. So here is where I am today. And I like to be able to be my tagline is the health detective. And so I like to be able to help people to be that health detective in their situation to find the root issues of their problems.

**Host:** That is very cool. Wow. Brian and I are looking at each other like, what?

## The Three Essential Oils for Thyroid

**Host:** So will you share with us what these three essential oils are that helped you get off your thyroid medication?

**Diane:** Yeah. They were myrrh, lemongrass, and the last one, so it's myrrh, lemongrass, clove. Clove was the last one. So it was, I applied it topically and it was just two drops of each of those that I would put on my throat. And I also put it on the reflexology point on my feet when the thyroid is located. And I would do that morning and night. And all two drops of each of these three oils applied at the same time to the two locations.

**Host:** To the two locations.

**Diane:** And something that I have to mention is that the purity of the oil is very important. You can't just go to your local, you know, Walmart, you know, your best buy or even the health food store and find the quality of the oil. You have to have something that has been tested and not just a normal GCMS testing, but way more than that to really get the most effect out of it.

**Host:** That's that's very interesting. I know a couple of people with thyroid issues and they're now going to become like guinea pigs. If I have to buy the oil myself, we've actually played with essential oils in a diffuser. And what we're doing is lemon because that citric, the scent of the citric acid, you know, triggers saliva production and causes us to continually sip water as well, which obviously helps with dry mouth and show.

**Diane:** Yes.

## Solutions for Dry Eyes

**Host:** So what solutions could you suggest for dry eyes? Are there any?

**Diane:** Oh, well, definitely. You know, we have to think first of all, you know, what are what are tears composed of? You know, they're composed of water, mucus, fatty oils, and you know, and a thousand other proteins there are there to lubricate the eye. And so when these things, you know, become in balance, that's where, you know, that's leading to dry eyes. So, so what can you help with that balance?

Now, some suggestions that that I would give with the essential oils. And first, I want to make a statement, make sure everybody understands that you don't ever put essential oils inside of your eyes. Okay, that that first of all is very irritating and it can cause damage. So make sure essential oils are not put inside of the eye. Okay.

Now, if it does get inside of the eye, I always tell people this little disclaimer, just go ahead and put like a regular vegetable maybe like an olive oil or corn oil, whatever on an napkin and just wipe your eyes, you know, right away that that'll get that sting out of that out of your eyes.

### Steam Inhalation Method

So, but the best way to really help your eyes is through steam inhalation. And what you can do is you can get a like a large bowl and get some hot water, you know, boil the water first, then put it in the bowl, get a towel, and then get it like a gentle essential oil like lavender or lemon, which you mentioned that you use. You can put two to three drops of the oil in the bowl there. And then just put your face over the bowl, put the towel, you know, over your head and over the bowl. So now you're getting the steam on your face. That's that's a good way to get help with the eyes and get the oils in the eyes without actually putting them putting it there.

### Other Methods for Dry Eyes

Another thing you can do is like making like a cooling gel with some aloe vera and apply the essential oils to that as well. Adding just a couple drops to that. You can do like a milk compress or you can get a cup of full fat milk. You want the fat in the milk there. Add the essential oils to it. And then you can get maybe some cotton pads dip it in there and just apply it to close your eyes and put those cotton pads on your eyes and leave it there for about 10 minutes. That can that can help a lot.

And another thing that I did I have found helpful with that and it doesn't have to do with essential oils but with coconut oil. Coconut oil having that fatty oil and you can actually put coconut oil inside your eye. Here's something that you can't put inside and and there have been some studies that show that the fatty acids of coconut oil they provide that protective layer and that can help keep the the eyes moist. And of course eating a lot of omega-3 rich foods will help a lot with that.

**Host:** Yeah I've heard of omega-3s. Now do you do this daily or a couple of times a day?

**Diane:** I would do it you know especially with Sjogren's where you're suffering from that daily. I would do it daily. And even you know in the morning and later on in the evening I would do it.

**Host:** Perfect. That's interesting. I never I never thought about compresses on the eyes to help with dry eyes.

**Diane:** Oh yeah and with essential oils see oil and water don't mix right and we know that from from high school. But what water will do to oil is dried it. And so if you put you know maybe dab the oils around around your eyes and then put a compress over it it will drive those oils into the area there and it will make sure that it absorbed absorbed a lot quicker.

**Host:** So does this practice add moisture to the eye or does it help your body produce tear?

**Diane:** It's going to do both things. It's going to you know add that moisture depending on what you know which one of the things that I mentioned that you're doing. But mostly what we're trying to do is to help you know repair and maybe restore some of that that moisture that those tears.

## Solutions for Dry Mouth

**Host:** In addition to the lemon and the diffuser what we're doing to help with dry mouth are there any other suggestions for dry mouth that either essential oils or or any other holistic approach might help?

**Diane:** You know with the lemon I don't know what you know what what made you get started with with using the lemon essential oils. But you know there have been studies that have shown that that there's a constituent that's called the lemon limonene that is in the essential oil lemon in most citruses that d-limonene is the one that has actually been studied to help repair you know the salivary and salivary glands and to help produce saliva and there's even other oils I mean most of the citruses have d-limonene that also like black pepper has it and we're talking essential oils here. Black pepper, spearmint, and dill you know these are oils that have that constituent in it.

### The Stanford Study on D-Limonene

And what's amazing there's a study that was done in Stanford that they were able to show that the limonene was stopping the trigger the cause salivary stem cells to self-destruct. So this is amazing because the majority of autoimmune diseases are about the body attacking itself right?

**Host:** Correct.

**Diane:** There's a failure to communicate properly between the cells and if we can clear that communication the body can heal itself. So what you know what oils have the most d-limonene is what we're trying to look for.

### Oil Purity and Quality

And again you know I mentioned before about the purity of the oil is so important so important here and I've done a lot of research with different essential oil companies and I've chosen personally myself to use it from a company called doTERRA because there's really no other company that does the amount of testing that doTERRA does to to ensure the purity. So that's going to be tops and also knowing that this company goes to the country where the plant grows the best therefore the oil is going to be that much more therapeutic.

### D-Limonene Content in Different Oils

So keeping that in mind now thinking you know what oils have of the citrus has have the most d-limonene in it because if that can help repair the salivary glands that's what we're headed for. So grapefruit grapefruit as at is at the top of the essential oils with d-limonene it's got 92% d-limonene in grapefruit followed by wild orange which has 90% then lemon which has 70% lime has 65% and and bergamot has 30% so knowing that these oils have this constituent in it now you know you can switch it around when you're doing you know you're doing your teas or you're doing drink it putting in your water and even diffusing them.

## Safety of Ingesting Essential Oils

**Host:** That's really interesting I have an off the wall question are essential oils pure enough or are is there anything that can harm you if they're ingested?

**Diane:** It depends on where you're getting your essential oils if you are going you know just to the local big box store here I would never ingest an oil from one of those stores and one of the ways where you can see how pure your oils are if you look at a bottle of essential oils and if you don't see a supplement fact label from the FDA on it do not ingest it because if that label is not on there it means that the company has not done their testing and they're not going to put themselves out to for a suit and say ingest this when they haven't done their testing.

**Host:** Got you. I mean you were rattling off like dill and I'm like oh dill pickle. I could drop a drop of dill essential oil on my tongue and be happy.

**Diane:** Yeah that that would help. I enjoyed dill quite a bit.

**Host:** I think I started using um a lemon in the diffuser because I think I have I don't know eating lemon or something and I produced a lot of saliva and I think that's how it started. I'm not sure. Well that and we will put lemon concentrate a couple drops in water just to help promote the salivary production.

**Diane:** Yeah so now you know why you produce saliva is because that that constituent that's an in in lemon and by the way there are hundreds of constituents in essential oil. D-limonene is just one of them but it is such a strong constituent for your need that you know you were able to to see that result when you drank it.

**Host:** And this d-limonene is in the actual fruit so consuming the fruit can help obviously correct.

**Diane:** It isn't the fruit the pulp itself but it's it's there at a greater degree in the actual skin of the fruit. And because essential oils are especially from the citrus are cold press from the skin not the pulp. Now you have a concentrated form of the constituent.

**Host:** Right right that makes sense.

## Lotions and Topical Applications

**Host:** Are there any lotions or bath additives that will help?

**Diane:** Yeah you definitely want to use as many modalities as you can with the essential oils so when I say modalities I'm talking about aromatically, topically and internally. So if we're talking about lotions here you need to first of all find yourself a good quality lotion that's not going to have parabens, no toxins and you want it to be scent free because you're going to be adding essential oils to it.

And yeah and so then you can switch the essential oils around you know we talked about the different ones you know the grapefruit, the wild orange, you know the lemon, the lime, the bergamot. You can switch those around in your lotion and that way you're you're confusing the toxins in your body so they don't know what's what's hitting them. You know when you're switching you know I always recommend that you switch up the oils you don't just use the same thing over and over and over again. But switch them up you know confuse, confuse those those bad guys in your body of what's coming you know what's coming in and then try something new every time. Just like when coach just say you know do something now confuse your body yeah that makes sense.

**Host:** Exactly. So do you do the same thing?

**Diane:** Yeah so you put the drops in the actual lotion or like when you squeeze a little in your hand. Yeah you can actually make your own you know kind of do it yourself thing get a you know two-ounce jar or a bigger one and then you know already prepare it you know pre-prepare it and and even mix up some of the oils in there you know not just lemon or not just lime but mix it up with needle peppermint a little bit you know of grapefruit lemon because with the interesting thing with essential oils you know in math one plus one is two but with oils one plus one can equal five because the synergy of the oils working together all those all those compounds can give you so many benefits.

**Host:** Interesting. Are there any lotions that you would recommend other than the ones preparing yourself that all I just mentioned I don't have any you know offhand that I could tell you you know go buy this.

**Host:** Got you okay. Is there is there a base that you could recommend? I mean I'm assuming when you're doing this for a medical approach it's it's probably a pretty bare-bone lotion no you know very little scent or anything like that.

**Diane:** Correct correct yeah so you could also use you know if you're out looking for for a lotion like that but you could also use coconut oil an organic coconut oil or fractionated coconut oil.



### Base Oils and Carriers

**Diane:** Correct correct yeah so you could also use you know if you're out looking for for a lotion like that but you could also use coconut oil an organic coconut oil or fractionated coconut oil. Fractionated coconut oil is going to be liquid at room temperature whereas the organic coconut oil is going to be solid at room temperature. But both of those are going to be great carriers for the essential oils.

And you can also use like jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, or even olive oil. These are all going to be good carriers for the essential oils. And the thing about carriers is that they're going to help the essential oils to penetrate the skin better and they're also going to help to dilute the essential oils so that they're not too strong on the skin.

### Bath Additives and Epsom Salts

Now for bath additives, you can definitely add essential oils to your bath. But you want to make sure that you're using a carrier oil or you're using something like Epsom salts to help disperse the oils in the water. Because if you just put the essential oils directly in the water, they're going to float on top and they could potentially irritate your skin.

So what I would recommend is getting some Epsom salts and adding maybe 5 to 10 drops of your essential oils to about a cup of Epsom salts. Mix that up really well and then add that to your bath water. The Epsom salts are going to help disperse the oils throughout the water and they're also going to provide some additional benefits for your muscles and your skin.

### Additional Holistic Approaches

**Host:** Are there any other holistic approaches that you would recommend for Sjogren's syndrome beyond essential oils?

**Diane:** Oh absolutely. Diet is huge. You know, we really need to look at what we're putting into our bodies because food can be medicine or food can be poison. And with autoimmune conditions like Sjogren's, we really want to focus on anti-inflammatory foods.

So things like leafy greens, fatty fish that are high in omega-3s, berries, nuts, seeds. These are all going to help reduce inflammation in the body. And we want to avoid things that are going to increase inflammation like processed foods, sugar, refined carbohydrates.

Hydration is also extremely important. You know, with Sjogren's you're dealing with dryness throughout your body, so making sure that you're drinking plenty of water throughout the day is crucial. And not just water, but you can also do herbal teas, you can add those essential oils that we talked about to your water.

### Stress Management

Stress management is another huge component. Stress can really exacerbate autoimmune conditions. So finding ways to manage stress whether that's through meditation, yoga, deep breathing exercises, spending time in nature, whatever works for you to help reduce that stress level.

Sleep is also incredibly important. Your body does most of its healing and repair work while you're sleeping. So making sure that you're getting quality sleep, 7 to 9 hours a night, is going to be really important for managing your symptoms.

### Supplements and Additional Support

And then there are some supplements that can be helpful. Things like vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics to support gut health. Because a lot of autoimmune conditions start in the gut, so supporting that gut health is going to be really important.

**Host:** That's fantastic information. This has been incredibly helpful. Where can people find you if they want to learn more about your work as the health detective?

**Diane:** Well, I'm still building my platform, but people can reach out to me through social media. I'm on Facebook and Instagram. And I'm always happy to help people investigate their health concerns and find natural solutions that might work for them.

**Host:** Wonderful. Well, Diane, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and your personal experience with us today. This has been incredibly valuable information for our listeners who are dealing with Sjogren's syndrome.

**Diane:** Thank you so much for having me. It's been a pleasure to share this information and I hope it helps people on their healing journey.

**Host:** And to our listeners, remember that this information is for educational purposes only. Always consult with your healthcare provider before making any changes to your treatment plan. Thank you for listening to another episode of Sjogren Strong, and we'll see you next time.
